### Automatic Removal

When you mark a todo as complete, the plugin automatically removes the `SCHEDULED` property:

**Before:**
```
TODO Buy groceries
SCHEDULED: <2024-01-15 Mon>
```

**After marking as DONE:**
```
DONE Buy groceries
```

### Supported Todo Formats

The plugin recognizes these completion patterns:

1. **Logseq Native:**
   - `TODO` → `DONE`
   - `TODO` → `COMPLETED`
   - `TODO` → `CANCELED`
   - `TODO` → `CANCELLED`

2. **Markdown Checkboxes:**
   - `[ ] Task` → `[x] Task`

3. **Simple Markers:**
   - `- Task` → `x Task`

The plugin works out-of-the-box with no configuration required. It automatically detects various todo completion formats and removes the `SCHEDULED` property accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not working?

1. **Check if the plugin is enabled:**
   - Go to Settings → Plugins
   - Ensure "Task Unschedule" is enabled

2. **Verify todo format:**
   - Make sure your todos use supported formats (TODO, [ ], etc.)

3. **Check console logs:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for "Task Unschedule Plugin" messages in the console
